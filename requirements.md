# StyleSwipe

## Problem
Users struggle to discover and curate personal style inspiration. Browsing fashion content is passive and overwhelming—there’s no quick way to filter what you like, save favorites, or build a cohesive style profile.

## Solution
StyleSwipe is a swipe-based style discovery app. Users swipe through outfit and fashion content (left to pass, right to save), building a personalized feed and style profile over time.

## Target User
- Fashion-conscious people who want to refine their style
- Shoppers looking for outfit inspiration before buying
- Anyone who enjoys quick, gamified discovery (similar to Tinder for style)

## Core Feature (MVP)
- Swipe interface: left to skip, right to save
- Curated feed of outfit/style images
- Saved collection of liked items
- Basic onboarding (e.g., style preferences)

## Nice-to-Have
- Style profile or mood board from saved items
- Share collections with friends
- Links to buy similar items
- Filters by category, color, or occasion
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Demo Flow
1. User opens app and completes quick onboarding (optional style preferences).
2. User sees first outfit image with swipe instructions.
3. User swipes right to save or left to skip; next image appears.
4. User taps “My Style” to view saved items.
5. User can remove items from saved collection with a tap.
