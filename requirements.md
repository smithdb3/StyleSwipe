# StyleSwipe

## Problem
We've all been there — endlessly scrolling through clothes online, not knowing what we actually want, and still feeling like we have no style. Browsing fashion content is passive and overwhelming: there's no quick way to filter what you like, save favorites, or build a cohesive style profile. The outcome is unclear and the experience is exhausting.

## Solution
StyleSwipe is a personal stylist in your pocket. Your phone learns your taste through the simple act of swiping: see an outfit, swipe right if you love it, left if you don't. Behind the scenes, our AI builds a picture of exactly who you are and what you wear. After just a few minutes of swiping, StyleSwipe starts showing you real clothes from real brands that actually match your taste — not what's trending, not what an algorithm thinks everyone wants, but what you specifically would wear. Think of it as Tinder for fashion: instead of finding a date, you're finding yourself. The app gets smarter every single swipe.

## Target User
- Fashion-conscious people who want to refine their style and "find themselves" through discovery
- Shoppers looking for outfit inspiration and real product recommendations before buying
- Anyone who enjoys quick, gamified discovery (Tinder for style)
- The next generation discovering how they want to dress

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Swipe interface:** Left = don't like, right = love. Simple and immediate.
- **AI style model:** System that builds a picture of the user's taste from every swipe.
- **Personalized feed:** Outfit and style content that reflects learned taste and improves as they swipe.
- **Real product recommendations:** Once enough data exists, show real clothes from real brands that match their taste.
- **Saved collection ("My Style"):** Liked items in one place; can evolve into real product picks as they swipe more.
- **Onboarding:** Short and optional (e.g., initial style preferences) so users get to swiping quickly.

## Value and Data
- **To the user:** Personalized discovery, clarity on their style, less noise — a stylist that actually gets them.
- **To brands and designers:** Valuable preference and engagement data; partnership opportunity at the ground floor of how the next generation discovers fashion.

## Nice-to-Have
- Style profile or mood board from saved items
- Share collections with friends
- Links to buy similar or recommended items
- Filters by category, color, or occasion
- Dark/light theme toggle
- "Why I like this" or style insights (reinforces personal-stylist and data value)

## Demo Flow
1. User opens app and completes quick onboarding (optional style preferences).
2. User sees first outfit image with swipe instructions; the AI will learn from each swipe.
3. User swipes right to save or left to skip; next image appears. Every swipe improves their personalized feed.
4. User taps "My Style" to view saved items and, over time, real product picks from real brands that match their taste.
5. User can remove items from saved collection with a tap.
